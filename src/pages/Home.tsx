            Hello! Iâ€™m Tyler Henry, a computer scientist passionate about signal processing. I've been working for the United States Air Force on the F-16's APG-68 Radar since graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from UVU. I love employing systems and tools that offer strong behavioral guarantees through well-defined semantics, type systems, and build environments.

            textIndent: "1.5rem",
          }}>
            In my personal time, I recently set up a fully-declarative and reproducible personal server using the Nix functional language and package manager. The software is built with impermanence to enforce a stateless system, while ZFS RAID, snapshots, ECC memory, and nix generations lead to an extremely reliable and accurate system.

          <Typography sx={{ 
            textIndent: "1.5rem",
            paddingBottom: {sx: "1rem", md: "0.5rem"},
          }}>
            I've been helping with the software development and design advising for Hive Dynamics, a recent start-up designing low-cost cruise missiles meant for mass production.
            I also have quite a few radio projects, including writing signal processing software for an SDR, studying for my Ham extra class licence, and building an HF Ham radio to allow me to communicate to a home radio server and send texts to family and friends via an XMPP to SMS service from nearly anywhere in the world.
