autonomous navigation of a drone. The program takes a downward-looking image from the drone and applies a number of filtering and matching techniques in order to determine where the drone's image matches with onboard satellite imagery. The matching location in the satellite image can be used to extract approximate coordinates for the drone in real time. Because the satellite imagery can be stored on the drone, the drone gains a large amount of autonomous abilities. After pairing with other positioning techniques (like IMU integration), I expect a drone flying a few hundred feet in the air should be able to complete waypoint missions without reliance on GNSS.",githubLink:"https://gitlab.com/tylrhnry/drone-nav",course:"CS 4700 Machine Learning",featured:!0},{title:"GPS Spoofing Detection",description:"I wrote a Rust program that, when coupled with common drone hardware (GPS and IMU), can work to detect artificial GPS signals meant to attack the drone. The program performs an integration on the accelerometer and gyroscope readings to estimate its relative position since the last verified location. If the new location is within the margin of error of the received GPS readings, we assume the drone is still receiving accurate GPS data. If the drone starts receiving GPS data that suggests it has been moving contrary to what the IMU has measured, we assume the GPS data is inaccurate. When validation is frequently performed, the sensor error can be continuously removed, leading to more accurate detection of adversarial signals.",githubLink:"https://github.com/tylrhnry/gps_spoofing_detection",course:"339R (Advanced Programming Language (Rust))",featured:!0},{title:"Missile Defense System",description:"This missile defense simulator was created from scratch to teach the Rust programming language to dozens of interns and professional C++ developers at the Air Force.

Any update or progress I make on any machine can seamlessly be applied to all of my systems, completely removing repetitive configuration, which when setting up and working with many systems, is a huge deal.
