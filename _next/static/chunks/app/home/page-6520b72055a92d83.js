The processing is all done real-time and onboard to allow navigation even if jamming is present.

If the new location is within the margin of error of the received GPS readings, we assume the drone is still receiving accurate GPS data. If the drone starts receiving GPS data that suggests it has been moving contrary to what the IMU has measured, we assume the GPS data is inaccurate.
